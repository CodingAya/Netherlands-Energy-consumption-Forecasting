# Netherlands-Energy-consumption-Forecasting

## Context
The data are anonymized by aggregating the Zipcodes so that every entry describes at least 10 connections.
The dataset used for this project is the kaggle dataset [Energy consumption of the Netherlands](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucabasa/dutch-energy).
It contains Gas and Electricity data of the Netherlands per year, from 2009 to 2020 -with missing data for some years-. The data was provided by the following companies:  
- Enexis
- Liander
- Stedin
- Enduris
- Westlandinfra
- Rendo
- Coteq
Each company releases on its website a table with the energy consumption of the areas under its administration.
